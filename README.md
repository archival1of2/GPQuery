GPQuery
============

## Overview

**GPQuery** is a [data visualisation][wiki-datavis] web application for historical Grand Prix Racing records dating back to 1950, written in Javascript and PHP by Jonathan Ho <joho@joho.us> as an educational and research project in full-stack development.

GPQuery consists of two custom-built applications: a front-end user interface written in [AngularJS][angular]; a back-end REST service based on an innovative pairing of [Slim Framework][slim] and [Laravel's][laravel] [Eloquent ORM][eloquent].

A third component comes in the form of a [MySQL][mysql] database and dataset provided by [Ergast Developer API][ergast]; this trio of components bears resemblance to a three-tier software architecture pattern.


## Structure

`GPQuery\Dashboard` - AngularJS front-end
`GPQuery\Engine` - Slim + Eloquent back-end
